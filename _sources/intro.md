# Crowdfunding Success Analysis using Kickstarter

## Introduction

Every project needs funding to reach a mass audience. There are various sources of funding for a project. One of them is crowdfunding. Crowdfunding allows the creator of the project to raise money from a large number of people through the internet. It can be considered a form of crowdsourcing that enables raising money outside of traditional financial systems such as banks {cite}`wikipedia_2022`. There were 6,455,080 campaigns crowdfunded in the year 2019 and it is projected that the number can grow to more than 12 million by 2023. It is projected that the crowdfunding market is expected to grow to USD 300 Billion by 2030 {cite}`shepherd_2020`. The three actors of the modern crowdfunding model are as follows {cite}`wikipedia_2022`:
1. Project Initiator - This person or a group of people initiates the project by proposing the idea to be funded
2. Supporters - People who support the idea financially
3. Moderator - This is the organization or platform that brings the concerned parties together to launch the idea. A few of the most famous ones include Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Crowd Supply etc.

The platform seeks to generate income for worthwhile projects by helping them connect to generous funders {cite}`wikipedia_2022`. Various attributes are responsible for the success or failure of crowdfunding for the project. Although the platforms publish many advice and best-practices articles on their blog but still more than half of the projects that are launched fail. This project is aimed at studying the effects of various attributes that affect the outcome of the project using the data from the Kickstarter website. On a high level, the following steps will be performed in the project. The data will be sourced from the Kaggle website. It will be checked for any discrepancies and if found any will be rectified. Then, exploratory data analysis will be performed to seek necessary insights from the data. Finally, two machine learning models - logistic regression and support vector machine - along with one neural network will be developed to find predict the success of the project before launching it.
