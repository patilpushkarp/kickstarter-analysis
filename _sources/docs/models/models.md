# Models

The following section will cover sections such as model building, inferencing with models, and evaluation of models for the below-mentioned models:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Artificial Neural Network

To evaluate the performance of models, the following evaluation metrics will be used:
1. Area Under the Curve of Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC ROC) - This metric is chosen to compare the models with different hyperparameters during the grid search.
2. F1 score - This metric is chosen because it is necessary to maximize the probability of success and hence focus is more on identifying the true positives more correctly and reducing the number of false positives.
