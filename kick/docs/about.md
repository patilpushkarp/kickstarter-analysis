## About the data

### Introduction

The data has been sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/most-kickstarter-campaigns-fail-here-s-why?select=kickstarter_data_with_features.csv), which is licensed under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0). It contains data on 20,632 projects as of February 1st, 2017.
By analyzing the data for different categories of projects, Kickstarter could see which categories are the most popular and adjust their website and/or marketing strategy to target those categories. Additionally, by using the data on successful campaigns, Kickstarter could attempt to replicate those campaigns that are most successful. Furthermore, Kickstarter could use this data to better understand why some campaigns are unsuccessful and provide advice or resources for future campaign creators to increase their chances of success.

### Research Ideas

- Data can be used to analyze failed projects to understand the reasons for project failures and then plan accordingly to improve the chance of success.
- This data can also be used to prioritize categories and then adjust the website.
