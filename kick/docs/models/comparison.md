# Comparing Models

To summarise, the best results and the associated metrics for each model are:

|Model|AUC ROC|F1 Score|Precision|Recall|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|Logistic Regression|0.883|0.82|0.82|0.82|
|Support Vector Machine Classifier|0.9514|0.88|0.99|0.88|
|Artificial Neural Network Classifier|0.9683|0.91|0.91|0.91|

For the above results, it can be concluded that the artificial neural network can be considered as the best model to predict the success of the Kickstarter project.
